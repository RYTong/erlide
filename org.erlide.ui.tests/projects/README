In this directory add test projects that can be imported in a workspace 
and tests can be run on them.

One of the goals is to have a set of projects that depend on each other and recreate
the most complex settings at user's site, including use of external_modules 
and external_includes.

This way we don't need to rely on testing at in a Shade environment.

== Project structure and references ==

external_modules and external_includes include all files in p1, p2 and p3

p1 -> p2 
 - m11 -> m12, m21, h11, h21
 - h11 -> h22
 
p2 : this prj should be tested as both open and closed (we check that stuff is found in the right place anyway)
 - m21
 - h21 
 
With these, we must test navigation and completion. To be defined.
