<h2>Technical details</h2>
<h3>Ttb</h3>
This feature uses an improved version of ttb (Trace Tool Builder,
<a href="http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/ttb.html">http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/ttb.html</a>
) for tracing purposes. "Improved" means that this version is currently not included in OTP and
comes as part of this plugin. This version is called here "ttbe" ("e" stands for "extended").
<br />
Ttb is built on top of
<a href="http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/dbg.html">dbg</a>
and provides some improvements which makes tracing easier. This feature provides graphical user
interface to ttb which makes using it more user friendly.

<h3>Tracing</h3>
Ttb is started on separate erlang node called "tracing" (
<code>-sname tracing</code>
, if necessary this name can be changed from
<a href="reference/preferences.html#nodeName">preferences window</a>
). It allows tracing tool to be independent from nodes you want to trace. "Tracing" node is
automatically started by erlide when any tracing action is performed for the first time (tracing
another node or loading trace data from file).
<br />
Traced nodes are treated as "diskless nodes", i.e. all data from them is directly sent to the
"tracing" node. After finishing tracing all data is writen to the directory named
<i>ttb_upload_erlide_tracing-Timestamp</i>
(
<i>Timestamp</i>
is in a form of yyyymmdd-hhmmss) into file called
<i>nodeName@hostName</i>
(there will be one file with data per node).

<p>When tracing is finished application reads all data from this directory using special data
handler provided to <code>ttbe:format/2</code> function which, instead of formatting data, sends it
directly to trace plugin which interprets it. <br />
Same action is performed when reading trace results from file.</p>

<h3>Connection</h3>
It is possible to connect to multiple nodes in the same time (also nodes started outside erlide) to
trace them. However, before starting tracing you should set properly value of
<i>Net Ticktime</i>
and cookies.

<h4><a name="netTicktime">Net Ticktime</a></h4>
It is very important that all nodes (traced nodes and tracing one) have set the same value of
<a href="http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/net_kernel.html#set_net_ticktime-1">Net Ticktime</a>
because this value is used for detecting nodes that are not responding.
<br />
Once every
<i>TickTime</i>
/4 seconds all connected nodes are "ticked". Time in which not responding node is detected is 0.75 *
<i>TickTime</i>
&lt T &lt 1.25 *
<i>TickTime</i>
.
<br />
<i>Net Ticktime</i>
is set using
<code>net_kernel:set_net_ticktime/1</code>
function. It's value can be specified in <a href="reference/preferences.html#netTicktime">preferences window</a>.


<h4>Cookies</h4>
Every two Erlang nodes communicating with each other should have set the same
<i>magic cookie</i>
. When you start Erlang node from console you can specify cookie's value using
<code>-setcookie Cookie</code>
parameter or later calling
<code>erlang:set_cookie(node(), Cookie)</code>
. For more details see
<a href="http://www.erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/distributed.html">this</a>
.
<br />
Each cookie specified in
<a href="reference/nodes.html">nodes tab</a>
is set using
<code>erlang:set_cookie(Node, Cookie)</code>
call.
